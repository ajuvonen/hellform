    I want to thank you for your patience and interest towards making The Internet a more accessible
    forum for everyone. With today's tools it feels like making this low level of usability is
    almost more difficult than doing things right, but still these examples are far from extinct in
    the services we use. There are multiple factors that contribute to this situation, but I'd like
    to take this opportunity to list a few good practices that will help you avoid the most obvious
    pitfalls.

    <li>
      Involve designers in your project as early as possible, and leave them in charge of design
      decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Plan and develop your services with the interests of various user groups in mind. Don't forget
      a group just because they're not your biggest demographic.
    </li>
    <li>Research, don't assume. Test your service on actual users during and after development.</li>
    <li>Be responsible. Only collect data that is relevant to the use of your service.</li>
    <li>Be honest. Don't try to trick your user into doing things they don't want to do.</li>
