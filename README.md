# hellform

This project demonstrates the absolute inusability of a form from Hell. It has been designed to be inconvenient, but still within the realm of possibility. It is an example of what one could expect when doing enough things wrong in a software project, starting with the lack of designers. It is not buggy per se, it's just...bad. 

The data on the form is not sent anywhere, as Hell doesn't really care for your submission, but I still recommend filling the information with mock data.
